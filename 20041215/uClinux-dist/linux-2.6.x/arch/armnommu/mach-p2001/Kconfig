	  The default sysclk is 12.288 MHz. For the ethernet unit to
	  work more than 25 MHz are needed. The sysclk is not set by
	  the linux kernel, but instead by etherboot. So this must be
	  the same as what etherboot is set to.
	  The following system clock frequencies are allowed:
	   12288000:  12.288 MHz
